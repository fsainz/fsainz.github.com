<p class="meta">February 17th, 2017 - Bonn</p>

I gave a talk at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Bonn-Agile/events/237159078/">February meeting of the Bonn Agile group</a> about different techniques to make debugging easier.
The slides alone are too sparse, I'll try to make a wiki with more details / snippets soon.
