I've been collecting some posts and videos about backbone js, and I wanted to share them before going to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/GermanDZ">@GermanDZ</a> talk on <a href="https://madridrb.jottit.com/enero_2012">Backbone + Rails + Handlebars</a>, but I just realized that most of them have been already published in the repository wiki:<br /> **<a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/wiki/Tutorials%2C-blog-posts-and-example-sites">Tutorials, blog posts and example</a>**

There we have a nicely structured list of tutotorials. Beside those listed there, these might be worth taking a look:
