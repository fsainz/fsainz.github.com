When developing in rails I use [watchr](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr) to run the tests each time a file is saved, but lots of times I find my self adding a whitespace or a newline and saving just to trigger watchr and run the tests.

I wanted to have is a simple keyboard shortcut (like `F15`) to tell watchr to run the last spec, and [mpartel](https://github.com/mpartel) (thx! : ) gave me an idea on [how to do it](https://github.com/mynyml/watchr/issues/31#issuecomment-1773937), so here it is.
