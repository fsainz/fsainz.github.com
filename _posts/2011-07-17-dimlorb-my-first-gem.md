Metro Ligero Oeste (MLO) is the tramway line I have to take every day. Knowing its timetables is extremely important, especially on weekends when you may have to wait 20 minutes if you miss one. They have recently made a [web page](http://www.dimlo.es) which is not awesome but does the job. Nevertheless I wanted more, I wanted a single-click web-app for my iphone that gives me only the information of the trams I take every day, the result: [diMLOya](http://dimloya.heroku.com/)

For that purpose I decided to create my first gem ever, you can check it out in its repo: [https://github.com/ariera/diMLOrb](https://github.com/ariera/diMLOrb)
