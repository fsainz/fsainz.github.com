These are the most interesting that we incorporated to our development
tools this year:


**Compass**

<a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a>, a set
of reusable patterns for Sass, is in conjunction with Sass the best
improvement that we've ever had in order to maintain a css library that
makes sense. Even if you don't intend to use it, take a look at the
source code for its mixins in the
<a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/" target="_blank">reference</a> to get ideas for your own mixins. 
<hr />
**Twitter Bootstrap**

Saves you a ton of time and gives you a good base to build upon. There's
a second contender on this space which I've heard it's pretty good,
specially handling responsiveness, it's in our New Year's resolutions to
check it out: <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb
Foundation 3</a>

<hr />
**Vagrant and Chef**

We have to struggle a little bit to get it up and running but now that
we got the hang of it we love it. 
As they say on the website, Vagrant lets you
*Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments.*, whereas Chef is responsible of handling your provisioning recipes.
It makes the "works on my machine" a thing of the past and it makes you
really easy to deploy and tinker first on your staging local server
before getting to production, which gives us a lot of peace of mind. We
also use Chef to provision a new production machine.

<hr />
** Coffeescript & Backbone **

<img src="/images/backbone.png" />

Both frameworks have made our javascript more readable, organized and
far more complex and powerful that we've never dared to try to develop.
Slow but steady, seems that all web apps are turning into javascript
apps.


<hr />
** Vim + tmux + iterm2 **

<img src="/images/vim-tmux-iterm.png" />

It's great for remote pair programming, it gives you a real time
experience even with below average connections. The best script that
I've seen to set it up is this one:

<code>brew install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/other/tmux-iterm2.rb</code>

Lately we've been enjoying a connection good enough to use the screen share tool trough imessage, and you can actually forget which computer is yours except when neither of you can type nor click for a couple of seconds (it happens time to time).
<hr />

** Capybara **

<img src="/images/capybara.png" />

It was about time that we started doing some browser testing, and though
we are still only covering some actions, it feels really good. We have
some timeout issues and our tests are pretty slow, but slow and
cumbersome tests are far better than no tests at all.

<hr />
** CodeSchool **

<img src="/images/codeschool_logo_final.png" />
From Envy Labs, it has made into the top of the list of learning
resources, along with <a href="http://railscasts.com/" target="_blank">railscasts</a> and <a href="https://peepcode.com/">Peepcode</a>. Really entertaining and practical tutorials, thanks to them we started digging into Backbone. 

<hr />
** Dev Chrome Tools **

<img src="/images/Google-Developers-Logo.png" />

It just gets better and better, we don't know how we did frontend
development before (that probably a little unfair to Firebug, which is
also great, but we ended up switching to Chrome for good..). There's
a great talk from igvita:

<a href="http://www.igvita.com/2012/11/14/wait-chrome-devtools-could-do-that/">Wait, Chrome DevTools could do THAT?</a>

<hr />
** MongoDB ** 

<img src="/images/mongo-db.png" />

We just finished the courses "Mongo 101 for developers" and "Mongo 102
for DBAs" that 10gen gave online for free on <a href="https://education.10gen.com">10genEducation</a>. We are looking forwarding to taking advantage of this freedom for modeling DBs next year.
