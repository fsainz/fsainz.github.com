  I was wondering how they differed, and it turns out that is a good practive to use <code>__send__</code> when you ignore whether the object receiving the message could have implemented a <code>send</code> method on its own.
</p>

<p> Besides, they ruby interpreter will give you a warning if you try to override <code>__send__</code> and it won't complain if you do the same with <code>send</code>

warning: redefining `__send__' may cause serious problems
