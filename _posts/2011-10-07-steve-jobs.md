Yesterday I read about the death of Steve Jobs right after waking up, and I thougt about why it saddened me besides the fact that someone so remarkable was gone. I think mainly of two thinks, this speech, and the fact that from my perspective this person was bringing "the future" closer.

One thing that I understand but which disspointes me is that our knowledge and technology is not so much limited by what we can get through our intelligence and ingenuity but by economic constrains. We tend to advance towards short-time profits, we are not focussed on racking our brains to solve every kind of problem, instead we advanced in some topics which receive resources for one reason or another. We have some independent research groups, and we have different companies who develop and research mostly what they need to compete. It's true that the computer industry provides tools to scientists which would've been completely unafordable, but knowing that research will get you longer lasting batteries sooner than curing the deasease that will kill you it's a little annoying. 

To make things worse, enterprises don't have to do better products than the others to be successful. A company can try to do something innovative but something crappy with a lower price or with a stronger marketing campaign is equally valid. I can admire google for expanding mankind's intelligence (nothing less :) and i can hate Telefonica for giving a damn about improving infrastructures while reporting the highest profits of the country and attempting to charge the user for every action the make on the internet. http://www.elpais.com/articulo/economia/Telefonica/supera/10000/millones/beneficio/plusvalias/Vivo/elpepieco/20110226elpepieco_7/Tes?print=1  http://www.publico.es/dinero/334214/telefonica-planea-el-fin-de-la-tarifa-plana-ilimitada. But I can not blame companies if the don't hurry to make innovative products because that0s not really their goal. The problem is that I was counting on them to do so because they have the power to do it.

.. And then it's when the ipod appeared...

I may have benn spoiled with futuristic objects from books and movies, but I see the computers we have and i feel like someone had taken me to the past. We've not only been inspired, we've seen realistic devices in a thousand videos and somehow i feel that i'm just waiting for the future to finally come. 
It seems almost a matter of time. I'm young and i've seen the first computer at my home go from a strange advance typewriter to become as fundamental as electricity. I've seen the mass adoption of mobile phones and the rise of internet, and in all this time is like if it was written somewehere "this is just the beginning"

We are waiting for our computer to stop being noisy overheated boxes of wires to instanteous and ubiquos machines, we want every sourfacece turned into a screen, we want perfect videoconferences, we want augmented reality, we want coordination and cooperation between devices to make our lifes more confortable, we want to be seamless coneccted everywhere everytime, we want solid virtual reality, we want personal robots, affordable spaceships, we want our organs cloned, our genome understood and (exploited) used to cure our illnesses, we want nanotechnology, insanely powerful quantum computers and cold fusion. We want everything that we believe to be achievable through ingenuity. And we would like to have it soon.

.. And then a friend show me his iphone --

And I didn't care about the phone part at all. It was a terminal. A futuristic portable termianl the way we had imagened it. I didn't think "ah, that's great", i though "finally!". Phones had had already applications, small screen slow akward applicactions prone to go accidentally online and charge you and which were as usable as browsing the internet by sending sms's. For years every sloppy _improvement_ added to my phone made me wish that they could just keep it as it was. 
What i wanted was a piece of internet in a rectangular format. I wanted a responsive machine in an simplified interface given the size, and they just aced it. Four years later, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop admitted (http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/08/nokia-ceo-stephen-elop-rallies-troops-in-brutally-honest-burnin/) that even then they didn't have a product close to their experience. For me it was a huge step towards being always connected, to the fact i could have a world of information in my hand. 


.. And then Three years later rumours said that they were going to present a tablet.

. We were there tryiying to study in the libray while they were about to broadcast something "revolutionary". by that time steve jobs had already turned into somesort of legendary inventor, and i had the kind of the excitement that you had in your stomach when a movie you've been waiting/anticipating for years it's about to start. We were happily waiting for the next object to crave and we were laughing at how ridiculuos we might looked like, but we would've watched the presentation with popcorn if we weren't in a library. 

We knew that other companies were working on cool technologies. We had seen videos of how they played with touch tables in their labs years ago, but we were still waiting. And then we suddenly had this man,  who is told to carry a 'reality distortion field' and who both fans and haters said to be obsserd with details, with the beauty of his products and the experience his provide. A man who apparently might fire you if he hapens to meet you on the elevator and thikns you are not competente, that got fired of his own enterprise, stopps a moment to launch Pixar, and went back to rocket apple from the floor to who knows wehere.

And this man was ready to present something outstanding. And when he went out and presented the ipad we had the feeling as if we were watching a mobile phone or a laptop for the first time. He was saying something like "this is the first time that someone got this right, and this is so good that everyone will love it". Tecnhology makes progess steadily and someday your processor is 4 times better, but this man was on stage, directing our expectations like a magician and promising to deliver something exiciting that we would soon have in our daily lives

Lost of people said that it would be useless, that they wanted a light laptop and not a large iphone, they mocked the idea and said how other companies had tried and failed because the market didn't like it. I was surprised for the avalance of critics, personally i whished that it succeeded to proof that the world wanted devices that bring computers to other parts of their lives. It was another step towards the screen table, the screen walls, the screen mirrors, the screen glasses.. anything we could imagine to make the way we interact with computers more close to the way humans would naturally interact with objects. There is a difference between a computer that fills up a wardrobe and stays in your office to they heavy but personal one that you put on a desk in your house, to the light but sturdy that you bring to the living room, the small one that you carry in your pocket, to the one you want to use on your sofa or the subway.  A tablet, for it's size and simplified controls was ideal for a huge new range of scenearios, but they had to proove it.

From that moment we were won over. Not that apple was perfect. Apple was (is) a brilliant company who wants our money and to have us well-tied in, who annoys their own developers many times and which for some reason believes that moving files with cut&paste is a bad day (it is not! change it damnit!)

But we are willing to go through many things if its what it takes enjoy this little pieces of "future". I command controll over your music library in exchange to the ipod. I will decide which apps are worthy of my device and get subscription fees on the iphone and ipad. I've just developed the robot EVA from WALLE while my competitors have talking toasters, but she will carry your credit cards from this day on.
Steve Jobs - his company - has imposed some enerving conditions but at the same times he has made sure that their products were worth it.


This is the first of the two reasons that will make me miss Steve Jobs. The second is just this video. Is the fact that he choosed to said something like this to his audience. I don't know how Steve Jobs was in person, possibly i wouldn't like him when he were to fire me in an elevator )http://crazyapplerumors.com/2005/02/15/jobs-fires-guy-just-visiting-apple-campus/), but I believe that he meant everyword he said:

>When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

>Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure – these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

steve created a company which products ... that people almost fight to advertise them themselves., to his products are synonim of modern technology. 

hubo 22 desarrollos de bombilla anterior a Edison pero el que conseguió llevarla a todas partes. Con los defectos de aquel hombre, en cualquier caso era alguien emperrado en conseguir esa bombilla que consigue fabricarla y que le lleva a todas partes. Luego ves la luz por todas partes y te cuentran que el hombre que se empeño conseguir esa bombilla y llevarla a todas partes ha muerto.

move the technology forward by getting people enthusiastic about it.don't know if we'll get to see a single person who manages to move the technology forward by making great innovative things and making people enthusiastic about them.

From our perspective, steve jobs was leading these technology revolutions like noone else had done before.

me siento mal por el ser humano que ha muerto y el dolor se sus seres queridos, porque era una persona que inspiraba a los demás con palabras y ehchos, y porque consiguió ilusionarnos, y acercanos mas al futuro. This man worked hard to bring us bright little pieces of the future, 

you can say it was a hard empresario, or that loved for his product it's just a crazy, but he
 he did all that because it was meaninful for him
 de uno de las poquísimas personas en el mundo que te hacen tener ilusión por lo que están haciendo.
 
 I don't know if we'll get to someone else who personifies innovation as he did.  Between his personality and theyHe was behing the creation of great products that we can use everyday   and who manages to make people so enthusiastic He was behind some great innovations things that we can enjoy day to day, and making people enthusiastic about them.To sum it up, I think he was speeding up the introduction of some technology advances that we could all enjoy day-to-day. 
  he managed to get everyone exicited with his personality and the continous innovations 
  that people all over the world enjoy on a daily basis.
