This is an example of what you can do with Pagebox, the new startup we've been working on. It's a SaaS CMS to create lists of posts, links and files which you can organize in multiple levels and embed in your site. It's not as customizable as other solutions but it's pretty fast to set up and the search is really smooth, <a href="http://www.pagebox.es">give it a try</a> ;)
