Icon fonts are our prefered way of dealing with icons since they became well supported, <a href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/" target="_blank">icon fonts are awesome</a> in the way that you can scale them at will while remaining sharp, and change their color and shadows. They also have a small size that you can make smaller if you reduce them to only the glyphs you need, and provide a more convenient bundle than css sprites. 

If flat and basically monochrome icons fit with your site they are great solution, and there is also a little hacky trick to get three colors in one icon element combining the pseudo classes :before and :after and taking advantage of _Semantic Ligatures_ using this technique : <a href="http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/08/16/three-color-semantic-icon-fonts/">http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2013/08/16/three-color-semantic-icon-fonts</a>.  A great example are the <a href="http://nikolaswise.github.io/devicons/">devicons</a> by the same author (nikolaswise).

The are some great sites to get free fonts (<a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a>, <a href="http://fontello.com/">Fontello</a>, <a href="http://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a>, <a href="http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons">Zurb</a>, ...) and affordable ones (<a href="http://symbolset.com/icons">SymbolSet</a> and <a href="http://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a> too)

Fontello and IcoMoon showcase mutiple fonts and let you pick the icons you want and combine them in a single font that you can download. Both tools are great but IcoMoon is just amazing.

**IcoMoon**

IcoMoon lets you import the popular free fonts (such as fontawesome or entypo) into their <a href="http://icomoon.io/app/">app</a> and purchase their own premium packs (they have a _Ultimate Package_ with 1266 dual tone icons for $59, not bad)

What its create is that you can combine these fonts with your own icons (with you upload in svg format):
