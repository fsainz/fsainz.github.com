I took advantage of the weekend to watch the videos from the last Techcrunch Disrupt through their <a href=”http://backlot.ooyala.com/syndication/podcast?id=40666c38-c233-4470-82c6-b62304f04683” >itunes feed</a>) and I made a compilation of the most common questions for the teams grouped by similarity:

<br />

which are your verticals?
which are your partners?

<br/>
**value proposition & differentiation**
>Why would I use this?

<br />
